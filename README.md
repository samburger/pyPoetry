pyPoetry
========
Creating computer poetry with Python.

Project Goals
-------------
*Procedural poetry* is a type of writing that emphasizes the process of creating a work.  One common example of procedural poetry is *erasure poetry*, which deletes words from a text to yield a poem.
This project will contain a number of scripts to generate different types of poetry using Python. 
So far, I have written scripts for random erasure poems as well as Markov-generator poems.

Eventually, this project will be migrated to a website to allow anyone to use it to create poetry.
